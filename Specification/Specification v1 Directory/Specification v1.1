Specification for Stage Manager
by Robert Hill-Guarino

Version 1.1

Overview:
Stage Manager is a piece of software that eases the workload of the stage manager by automating time consuming tasks or repetitive tasks. Stage Manager also leverages the data it holds in intersection ways to benefit the production.

Scenarios/Goals:
- A stage manager needs to be able to print any document created in Stage Manager aside from the prep list.
- A stage manager needs to change a line in the script. They use the Stage Manager to update the line and then generate a new script (See section on documents). Later, the line needs to be changed back, so the old version is recalled.
- A stage manager needs to schedule rehearsal for the next day. Stage Manager shows them that there are several approved conflicts for the day and that the lead actor is coming up on their legal amount of hours of work for the work week. The software also knows that the rehearsal room cannot fit the amount of people necessary in it to do the required rehearsal.
- A stage manager needs to record the blocking of an actor. The stage manager puts the blocking in the script and it is recorded on a slip sheet (See section on documents and intersectional data usage).
- A stage manager needs to put in a cue and have it recorded in their script at a amorphous position of their choosing.
- A stage manager needs to note what lines were missed and how they were missed (See section on documents).
- A stage manager needs to be able to see the contact information of every person on the production and by interacting with the list generate different distribution lists. These lists should be able to be saved and recalled to email different documents to.
- A stage manager needs tp be able to record notes during rehearsal into a log book. These should then be placed into the rehearsal report as needed.
- A stage manager needs to be able to generate a rehearsal report about the rehearsal. This should include all the notes taken from the log book and any additional notes (See section on documents).
- A stage manager needs to be able to generate a daily call (See section on documents).
- A stage manager needs to be able to generate a prop list for the show. The location of these props will be tracked on a run sheet throughout the show (See section on documents).
- A stage manager needs to be able to generate a run sheet for the show that shows all the actions that will occur on the deck. Furthermore, additional, supplementary run sheets must be able to be created for the show. These run sheets should be fully customizable and able to be generated on a person by person basis, while also having an option to highlight a single person?s options (See section on documents).
- A stage manager must be able to generate a page by page and a scene by scene from the current script (See section on documents).

Documents and Goals for Documents:

- All Documents:
= General:
* All documents, generally, should have a header and footer. These serve to identify what show and house the documents belong to and what purpose the document serves, who created the document, what order the pages of the document fall in, and what the date of creation of the document was.
* Certain documents will have specific requirements as to what is in the header and footer.

- Script:

* A script is a document that holds the lines of a show in the order they are to be said. It also contains the stage directions of a show, both attached to lines and in a free-floating manner.
